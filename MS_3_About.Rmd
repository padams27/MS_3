## About

The aim of my project is to explore the relationship between the 2016 UK 'Brexit' referendum and other data points 
relating the region where the votes were cast to the age and employment levels. The point of this is to try and 
either dispel or prove the common belief that the older the voter was the more likely they were to vote to leave 
the EU. The same is true for the supposed realtionship between unemployment and voting for leave. To do this I have 
used the UK goverment EU referendum data and the 2011 nationwide census data, both freely available online.
